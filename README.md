# Bank Transfer Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed as part of a .NET bootcamp challenge offered by DIO (Digital Innovation One). The project is a bank transfer application implemented using C# that operates via the console.

## Challenge Overview

The Bank Transfer Console Application challenge was part of a .NET bootcamp offered by DIO. The challenge aimed to test participants' knowledge and skills in C# programming and console application development. Participants were required to create a bank transfer application with specific functionalities and requirements.

## Features

- **C# Programming**: Demonstrate proficiency in C# programming concepts.
- **Console Application**: Develop a bank transfer application that operates via the console.
- **Bank Transfers**: Implement functionality to perform bank transfers between accounts.
- **Console Input/Output**: Utilize console input/output mechanisms to interact with the application.
- **Account Management**: Allow users to manage accounts, including creating new accounts, viewing balances, and updating account information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Bank Transfer Console Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET 5 SDK or later: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
